# 30 Days Coding Challenge

A personal initiative to develop **one coding project per day** for 30 consecutive days, beginning on **May 15, 2025**.  
This challenge is designed to improve technical skills, foster consistency in programming, and expand my portfolio through hands-on projects.

## How to Run Locally

Each project is contained in its own directory. To run a specific project:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd 30-days-coding-challenge

# Navigate to any project directory
cd day1-counter-app

# Option 1: Use Live Server (VS Code extension)
# Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server"

# Option 2: Open directly in browser
# Double-click index.html or drag it to your browser

# Option 3: Use Python's built-in server
python -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```
